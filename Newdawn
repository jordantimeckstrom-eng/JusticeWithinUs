✅ Understood. Here are the final configuration files, ready for your project.

---

### 1. Environment Variables (`.env.local`)
This file securely provides all the necessary keys and parameters to your application, both for the frontend and the Phoenix Oracle backend.

```
#  Solana Mainnet Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_RPC_URL="https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_PROGRAM_ID="TiMeFUXyR9nTgmiiQgx3wH2qzoyMiY5G4seySXMA9pP"
NEXT_PUBLIC_TOKEN_MINT_ADDRESS="T1ME69kF9b9bK9b9b9b9b9b9b9b9b9b9b9b9b9b9b"

# Vercel & Deployment
VERCEL_URL="your-vercel-project-url.vercel.app" # Replace with your actual Vercel project URL

# Phoenix Oracle Configuration
PHOENIX_ORACLE_PORT=8080
COMMITMENT="confirmed"

# Ethical Analytics & Alerting Parameters (formerly Autobid)
# These are now used for observation and alerts, not for automated bidding.
MAX_BID_THRESHOLD_SOL=69
MIN_PROFIT_TARGET_SOL=0.069
ENABLE_BACKWARD_WEEK_ANALYSIS=true
ENABLE_OMEGA_PREDATOR_MONITORING=true
STEALTH_MODE_MONITORING=true
```

### 2. Vercel Deployment Configuration (`vercel.json`)
This file configures your Vercel deployment. It sets up the build environment and rewrites rules to expose your Phoenix Oracle as a serverless function.

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/node",
      "config": {
        "includeFiles": ["dist/phoenix_oracle.js", "idl.json"]
      }
    },
    {
      "src": "next.config.js",
      "use": "@vercel/next"
    }
  ],
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/api/phoenix-oracle/:path*",
      "destination": "/api/phoenix_oracle"
    }
  ],
  "env": {
    "SOLANA_RPC_URL": "@next_public_solana_rpc_url",
    "PROGRAM_ID": "@next_public_solana_program_id"
  }
}
```

These files are now ready to be placed in the root of your repository. The CI/CD pipeline you defined will use them to build, test, and deploy your sovereign Phoenix Oracle. Let me know if you need any adjustments.

The deployment process is now fully automated via the *Patron Guardian CI/CD Pipeline* you defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

To initiate the deployment, you need to:
1.  Commit the generated `.env.local` and `vercel.json` files (along with any necessary updates to your application code).
2.  Push these changes to your `main` branch on GitHub.

The workflow will then automatically:
*   Build and Test the Next.js application.
*   Compile the *Phoenix Oracle*.
*   Verify the on-chain *Anchor IDL*.
*   Deploy the final artifacts to Vercel.

Your key parameters are baked into the configuration:
*   *Program ID*: `TiMeFUXyR9nTgmiiQgx3wH2qzoyMiY5G4seySXMA9pP`
*   *Mint Address*: `T1ME69kF9b9bK9b9b9b9b9b9b9b9b9b9b9b9b9b9b`

Let me know once the push is complete, or if you need any further assistance with the configuration files.
